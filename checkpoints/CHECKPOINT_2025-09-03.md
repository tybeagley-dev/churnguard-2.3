# ChurnGuard 2.2 Development Checkpoint
**Date:** September 3, 2025
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** Major progress made, 2 critical issues remaining

## üéØ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Frontend Crash Resolution
- **Fixed**: Frontend TypeError about 'slice' being undefined
- **Solution**: Copied working React assets from 2.1 repo copy and updated index.html references
- **Result**: ChurnGuard 2.2 frontend now loads successfully

### ‚úÖ Historical Performance Section - Complete
- **Fixed chronological ordering**: Changed from DESC to ASC (left-to-right timeline)
- **Added proper account filtering**: Only count accounts during their active periods
- **Implemented dynamic 12-month rolling window**: Sep 2024 ‚Üí Aug 2025 based on current date
- **Excluded current month**: Historical view stops at August 2025
- **Account counts match 2.1 baseline**: ~700 accounts in Sep 2024, ~900 in Aug 2025

### ‚úÖ Monthly Trends Section - 90% Complete  
- **Resolved .split() frontend crash**: Added missing API response fields (period, periodLabel, month_label, summary object)
- **Fixed chronological ordering**: ASC order matching Historical Performance
- **Implemented dynamic rolling window**: Sep 2024 ‚Üí Aug 2025 + Sep 2025 (current month)
- **Added current month**: September 2025 included with visual delineation capability
- **Working API structure**: Returns 13 months of data with proper formatting

### ‚úÖ Risk Level Implementation - Core Logic Complete
- **Added historical_risk_level column** to monthly_metrics table
- **Implemented correct risk calculation logic**:
  - **ARCHIVED accounts**: High risk only in archival month
  - **FROZEN accounts**: High if no texts, Medium if has texts  
  - **LAUNCHED accounts**: Flag-based system with weighted Low Engagement Combo (2 points)
- **Created populate-historical-risk-levels.js script** with proper flag counting
- **Risk distribution for historical months**: ~13% high, ~19-25% medium, ~62-68% low

### ‚úÖ Database and Architecture
- **Full 13-month simulation**: August 2024 through September 2025 
- **Proper temporal account filtering**: Accounts counted only during active periods
- **SQLite database**: 1,340+ accounts with complete monthly metrics
- **Account ETL fixes**: Include all historically active accounts vs only survivors

## üö® Critical Issues Remaining

### Issue #1: Medium Risk Layer Too Large (2.2 vs 2.1 Discrepancy)
- **Problem**: 2.2 shows ~22-27% medium risk vs 2.1's expected ~16%
- **Cause**: Risk calculation logic differences between 2.1 and 2.2
- **Impact**: Visual discrepancy in Monthly Trends chart proportions
- **Status**: Identified but not yet resolved

### Issue #2: September 2025 Risk Calculation (Current Month)
- **Problem**: Current month shows 64% high risk, 33% medium, 3% low (completely wrong)
- **Root Cause**: API using pre-calculated `historical_risk_level` for current month
- **Technical Issue**: 
  - 511 records have NULL `historical_risk_level` (ignored by API)
  - 677 records incorrectly marked as 'high' risk
  - Should use **live calculation** for current month, not historical values
- **Impact**: Current month visualization completely incorrect
- **Status**: Root cause identified, solution planned but not implemented

## üîß Technical Architecture Status

### Working Components
- **Express Server**: Running on port 3002 with all endpoints
- **SQLite Database**: Complete with 14,474+ monthly metrics records
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/historical-performance` ‚úÖ Working correctly
  - `/api/bigquery/monthly-trends` ‚ö†Ô∏è Working but has current month issues
  - `/api/bigquery/accounts` ‚úÖ Working
- **Risk Calculation Script**: `populate-historical-risk-levels.js` ‚úÖ Working for historical months

### File Changes Made
- **server.js**: Updated all API endpoints with proper date ranges and formatting
- **index.html**: Fixed React asset references  
- **scripts/populate-historical-risk-levels.js**: Complete risk calculation implementation
- **Frontend assets**: Copied from 2.1 repo copy

## üìã Next Session Action Items

### Priority 1: Fix Current Month Risk Calculation
- **Modify Monthly Trends API** to use live calculation for current month:
  ```sql
  CASE 
    WHEN mm.month = strftime('%Y-%m', 'now') THEN 
      -- Live risk calculation logic here
    ELSE 
      -- Use historical_risk_level for past months
  END
  ```
- **Test current month** shows reasonable proportions (~10-15% high, ~15-20% medium, ~65-75% low)

### Priority 2: Debug Medium Risk Discrepancy  
- **Compare risk flag logic** between 2.1 and 2.2 implementations
- **Analyze specific accounts** flagged differently between versions
- **Adjust flag thresholds** if needed to match 2.1 distributions

### Priority 3: Final Testing & Validation
- **Verify all sections** load without errors
- **Compare final results** with 2.1 baseline screenshots
- **Test visual delineation** of current month (diagonal stripes)

## üóÇÔ∏è Current State Summary
**ChurnGuard 2.2** is ~85% functional with a working frontend, complete Historical Performance section, and mostly-working Monthly Trends. The core architecture and data pipeline are solid. Two risk calculation issues remain before the application matches 2.1 functionality with the new PostgreSQL simulation architecture.

**Time Estimate to Complete**: 1-2 hours focused debugging and API modifications.
