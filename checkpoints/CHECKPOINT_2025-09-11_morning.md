# ChurnGuard 2.3 - September 11, 2025 Morning Checkpoint

## Current Status: STABLE WORKING VERSION

### ✅ Completed Today
1. **Application Launch** - ChurnGuard 2.3 successfully running at http://localhost:3002
2. **ETL Pipeline** - Successfully updated database with 2025-09-10 data
3. **Complete React Environment Recreation** - Rebuilt from source files to avoid minification issues
4. **Styling Fixed** - Corrected Tailwind content paths in `tailwind.config.ts` to enable CSS generation
5. **Server Configuration** - Fixed static file serving from `dist/` instead of `public/` directory
6. **Monthly Trends Diagonal Stripes** - Achieved perfect translucent white stripes (rgba(255,255,255,0.3)) over colored bars for current month indication
7. **Data Consistency Issue Resolved** - Both Historical Performance and Monthly Trends now show 921 accounts for August 2025

### 🔧 Key Technical Fixes
- **Tailwind Config**: Changed content paths from `["./client/index.html", "./client/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]` to `["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]`
- **Server Static Files**: Updated `server.js` to serve from `dist/` directory instead of `public/`
- **Stripe Pattern**: Final SVG pattern uses 8x8 pattern with 4px white stripe overlay for ~7 stripes across
- **Database Cleanup**: Removed empty `data.db` file, using only `./data/churnguard_simulation.db`

### 📊 Current Data Status
- **Database**: Using `./data/churnguard_simulation.db` with tables: `accounts`, `daily_metrics`, `monthly_metrics`
- **Historical Performance**: 921 accounts for August 2025
- **Monthly Trends**: 921 accounts for August 2025 (data consistency achieved)
- **ETL**: Current through 2025-09-10
