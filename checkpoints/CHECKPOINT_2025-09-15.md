# ChurnGuard v2.3 Checkpoint - September 15, 2025

## Overview
This checkpoint documents the completion of risk indicator visualization enhancements in the account detail modal chart, improving the user experience and data clarity.

## Recent Enhancements Completed

### 1. Risk Level Background Indicators
- **Feature**: Added colored background zones to the 12-month performance chart
- **Implementation**: ReferenceArea components with color-coded risk levels
- **Colors**:
  - High Risk: Red (rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.15))
  - Medium Risk: Orange (rgba(234, 88, 12, 0.15))
  - Low Risk: Green (rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.15))
- **Data Source**: Uses historical risk levels from database (`risk_level` column)
- **Opacity**: 15% for subtle visual indication without overwhelming the chart

### 2. Enhanced Tooltip Experience
- **Risk Information**: Tooltips now display risk level and reasons from database
- **Smart Positioning**: Improved tooltip logic to show risk data for the nearest data point
- **Consistency Fix**: Resolved UX issue where background colors didn't match tooltip risk levels
- **Database Integration**: Shows `risk_reasons` array from historical data

### 3. Interactive Chart Improvements
- **Active Dots**: Hover dots now increase in size (radius 4→6) instead of shrinking
- **Bold Borders**: Active dots have enhanced stroke width (2→3) for better visibility
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of which data point is being inspected

### 4. UI Polish
- **Flag Removal**: Eliminated unwanted flag icons that appeared on certain accounts
- **Color Consistency**: Background colors perfectly match legend risk indicator squares
- **Professional Appearance**: Subtle visual indicators that don't overwhelm the data

## Technical Implementation

  - Enhanced tooltip with coordinate-based risk data selection

### Database Integration
- Utilizes `historical_risk_level` column for accurate risk display
